                    li  Performed analytics on four yearsâ€™ worth of pitch data in MLB, analyzing different factors that impact how Umpires call strikes on pitches thrown outside the strike zone.

                    li Utilized R and several libraries to perform our analysis, including GGPlot2 for graphs and charts and SQLDF to query our data.
